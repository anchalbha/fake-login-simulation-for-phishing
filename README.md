I created this Phishing Awareness Simulation project as a way to help people understand how phishing actually works — not just in theory, but in a way you can see and interact with. Using Kali Linux, I set up a local web server with Apache and created a fake login page (index.html) that looks like a real login form. When someone types in their credentials, the backend script (post.php) captures that information and saves it to a file (harvester.txt). But instead of doing anything malicious, the page then redirects users to an awareness page (awareness.html) that explains what just happened and shares tips on how to recognize and avoid phishing attempts in real life. The goal is to simulate what a phishing attack might look like, so people can be more cautious and informed. All the files — from the fake login page to the awareness content — are organized and stored locally in the /var/www/html/ directory and served using Apache. You can view the simulation by simply entering the local IP in your browser. I’ve uploaded everything to GitHub so it’s easier for others to explore, learn from, or even build upon. You can find the full project here: https://github.com/anchalbha/fake-login-simulation-for-phishing. Just to be clear, this project is meant only for learning and awareness. It’s not to be used for anything unethical or illegal. Through this little experiment, I hope it becomes easier for others to understand how easily phishing can fool people — and why it’s so important to stay alert online.
